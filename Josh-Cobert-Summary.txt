Synopsis
--------
  This bug was caused by the render method trying to access properties of the weatherResult object, 
which was still set to its initial value of null at time of first render. 
Similarly, a bad API call would yield the same result.
  My solution is to validate weatherResult and conditionally render either: 
the weather data (if API call is made successfully), 
a loading message (if weatherResult still null), 
or no results found message (if API call yields no results).

Actions Taken
-------------
index.ts
  - Made city input field required

city-weather.tsx
  - Moved API call into its own function, getWeather()
  - Added validation of weather data fetch results before rendering
  - Defined componentDidUpdate method to fetch new weather data

Actions Taken
-------------
city-weather-refactor.tsx
  - Tracked states for the weather data, API fetch status, and API call success status
  - Render loading spinner if fetching
  - Render no results found component if city not found
  - Create utility functions for titlizing string (used for description) and grabbing weather icon url
  - Set component as aria-live and busy when fetching

index.test.tsx
  - Test improvements unsuccessful and to be continued
